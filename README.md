## Why I created this game
'''
The reason behind deciding to make my own version of this game was inspiried by the course I am doing but also wanted to showcase what i've learnt so far.
This game will cover everything from declaring variables, using conditionals, getting user input, lists, while loops, functions, and the random module.
